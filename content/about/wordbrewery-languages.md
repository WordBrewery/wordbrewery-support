As WordBrewery continues to grow and attract subscribers and donors, we will add additional languages and continue to add new features, technology, natural language processing libraries, recordings, text-to-speech engines, and news sources to the languages we already have. The exact features available vary by language. We usually introduce new features and improvements for Spanish and English first, then for French, German, Italian, and Japanese.

Future languages we may add include Dutch, Thai, Czech, Esperanto, Hindi, Vietnamese, Afrikaans, Swahili, Persian/Farsi, Bulgarian, Romanian, Welsh, Gaelic, Icelandic, and others. However, we can only add languages if we have enough subscribers to afford it. To help us improve our current languages and add new langauges as quickly as possible, please consider [subscribing](https://wordbrewery.com/subscriptions) to WordBrewery, contributing to our [new languages fund](https://squareup.com/store/wordbrewery2), and mentioning [WordBrewery](https://wordbrewery.com) to the language learners and teachers in your life. We have no marketing budget and rely on word-of-mouth mentions and recommendations to help learners discover us. Every small action our users take to build WordBrewery helps us become a more useful language-learning resource.
