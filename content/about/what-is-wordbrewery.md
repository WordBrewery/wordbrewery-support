## Introducing WordBrewery

WordBrewery teaches languages one sentence at a time. We extract sentences from newspapers around the world, then test each sentence with our revolutionary algorithm so you learn the most important words and grammar as quickly as possible. Whatever native speakers read, you can read tooâ€”whether you have been studying for ten years or ten minutes. For a limited time, we are offering a [basic subscription for only $4.99 per month](https://wordbrewery.com/subscriptions). Nonsubscribers can try the site by studying up to 30 sentences per month for free.

# WordBrewery's features

Here are some of the ways WordBrewery can help you learn one of the twenty languages we teach:

- Learn grammar and high-frequency vocabulary in context by studying authentic sentences scored by length and word frequency.
- Click the newspaper icon to see the original news story from which a sentence was pulled.
- Click a word in a sentence to see another example sentence containing that word.
- Check your understanding with machine translations of sentences from both Google Translate and Microsoft Translator.
