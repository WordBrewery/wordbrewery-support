# "I registered and activated my account, but I can't log in."

We have a very small development team and sometimes experience login bugs; the quicker we learn about these, the quicker we can fix them. Please take the following steps:

1. Email us at admin@wordbrewery.com to describe the problem.

Please include the following information in your email:

a. the steps you took to encounter the problem;

b. exactly what the website did that prevented you from logging in;

c. what login method you tried (i.e. email and password, Facebook, or Google);

d. what platform or device you are using (iOS/iPhone/iPad, Windows, Mac/OSX, or Linux Ubuntu/Fedora/etc.), and

e. what browser you tried (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, or Edge).

2. Try clearing your browser cache as described at https://wordbrewery.com/support/cache-clear. This ensures that you are seeing the most recent version of our site and removes any browser cookies that could be causing trouble.

3. Try logging in through a different method; for example, if you couldn\'t log in with an email address and password, try logging in with Google or Facebook.

4. Try logging in on a different device or browser. In general, we usually have better luck with the  Chrome browser and desktop / laptop / Android devices rather than Apple Safari and OSX or iOS devices. We do not recommend Internet Explorer or Edge.  However, we try to immediately fix problems that arise on any of these browsers or platforms.
