# Help WordBrewery teach the world how to read

WordBrewery is a complex application that is very expensive to build and retain. We have no outside funding and no marketing budget, so we rely on your {{% blank "subscriptions" "https://wordbrewery.com/subscriptions" %}}, {{% blank "donations" "https://squareup.com/store/wordbrewery2" %}}, and word-of-mouth support to make the app possible.

*{{% blank "Click here" "http://feeds.feedburner.com/LanguageUntapped" %}} to receive new posts from The WordBrewery Blog by email or RSS, and {{% blank "click here" "http://goo.gl/pTPRvb" %}} to join our email community. If you haven't tried reading the news in another language on WordBrewery yet, please give it a try. We offer a {{% blank "basic monthly subscription" "https://wordbrewery.com/subscriptions" %}}  for about the price of a cup of coffee. Your support helps us grow and build more useful features and content for language learners around the world.*
