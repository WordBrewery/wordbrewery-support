# "Does WordBrewery store credit card information for subscribers?"

No. Our purchasing system is handled by Stripe (https://stripe.com), a highly secure and reputable payment processor. We do not store any of your credit card data in our own databases. You can read about Stripe's security practices at https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe.
