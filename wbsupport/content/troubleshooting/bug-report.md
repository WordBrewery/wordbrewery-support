# "How can I submit a bug report?"

We have a very small development team and sometimes experience bugs; the quicker we learn about these, the quicker we can fix them. Please take the following steps:

1. Email us at [admin@wordbrewery.com](mailto:admin@wordbrewery.com) to describe the problem.

Please include the following information in your email:

a. the steps you took to encounter the problem;

b. exactly what the website did that prevented you from logging in;

c. what login method you tried (i.e. email and password, Facebook, or Google);

d. what platform or device you are using (iOS/iPhone/iPad, Windows, Mac/OSX, or Linux Ubuntu/Fedora/etc.), and

e. what browser you tried (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, or Edge).

We welcome bug reports, feedback, and feature requests. We have a very small team and cannot respond to every email, but we do our best to respond to customer and user emails within 24 hours. *We always prioritize support requests from [subscribers](https://wordbrewery.com/subscriptions).* Thank you for using WordBrewery.
