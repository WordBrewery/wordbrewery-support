As WordBrewery continues to grow and attract subscribers and donors, we will add additional languages and continue to add new features, technology, natural language processing libraries, recordings, text-to-speech engines, and news sources to the languages we already have. The exact features available vary by language. We usually introduce new features and improvements for Spanish and English first, then for French, German, Italian, and Japanese.

Future languages we may add include Thai, Dutch, Hindi, Vietnamese, Afrikaans, Swahili, Persian/Farsi, Bulgarian, Romanian, Welsh, Gaelic, Icelandic, Esperanto, and others. Please consider [subscribing](https://wordbrewery.com/subscriptions) to WordBrewery or contributing to our [new languages fund](https://squareup.com/store/wordbrewery2) if you are interested in helping us add new langauges as quickly as possible. You can also help a lot by letting other language learners know about WordBrewery. We have no marketing budget and rely primarily on word-of-mouth to help learners discover us. Every small action our users take to build WordBrewery helps us become a more useful language-learning resource.
