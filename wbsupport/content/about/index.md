WordBrewery teaches languages one sentence at a time. We extract sentences from newspapers around the world, then test each sentence with our revolutionary algorithm so you learn the most important words and grammar as quickly as possible. Whatever native speakers read, you can read tooâ€”whether you have been studying for ten years or ten minutes. For a limited time, we are offering a [basic subscription for only $4.99 per month](https://wordbrewery.com/subscriptions). Nonsubscribers can try the site by studying up to 30 sentences per month for free.
